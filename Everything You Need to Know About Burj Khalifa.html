<h1>Everything You Need to Know About Burj Khalifa</h1>

<p>Burj Khalifa was originally called Burj Dubai, or Dubai Tower. The word Burj in Arabic means tower, and the skyscraper has been renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.</p>

<p>The construction of the Burj Khalifa began as a world-class engineering challenge but matured in a time of economic crisis for the government of Dubai. The construction was completed thanks to the help of the Abu Dhabi government which lent a large sum to the city of Dubai.</p>

<p>Burj Khalifa has redefined construction standards for large buildings. Here the best engineers from all over the world worked to overcome the technical challenges and to develop new solutions.</p>

<p>Downtown Dubai, the area where Burj Khalifa is located, was born as a project for a modern integrated city, a model for the cities of the future. The most modern technologies and the most advanced materials have been used.</p>

<p>The Burj Khalifa is 828 meters high and has 163 floors plus 2 underground floors.</p>

<h2>Burj Khalifa: architecture between tradition and modernity</h2>

<p>The Burj Khalifa is a mixed-use skyscraper: there are private apartments and spaces open to the public, offices, restaurants, nightclubs, and observation decks for visitors.
</p>

<p>The architecture of Burj Khalifa is inspired by Islamic architecture and reflects canons of innovation and modernity, thanks also to the use of light and innovative materials and the massive use of glass surfaces that allow an extraordinary 360° view.</p>

<p>The shape of the tower was modelled to withstand the strongest winds and intense earthquakes. Absolutely innovative systems have been used to guarantee maximum safety in the event of a fire and to reduce the environmental impact: intelligent systems for air conditioning, water recovery and recycling in irrigation systems and fountains.</p>

<p>The interiors have been designed to reflect typical elements of the local cultural heritage fused with novelty characters thanks also to the contribution of designers from all over the world.</p>

<h2>What’s inside Burj Khalifa?</h2>

<p>In the lower floors there is a luxury hotel, the Armani Hotel, 15 floors and 304 rooms of pure elegance signed by one of the best Italian designers. On the upper floors there are over 900 private apartments, indoor and outdoor pools, corporate offices and representative suites.</p>

<p>On the 122nd floor there is the Atmosphere restaurant. At levels 124 and 125 there is the At the Top Burj Khalifa Observation Deck which allows visitors to enjoy the view of Dubai from 452 meters in height.</p>

<p>A further observation deck, called At the Top Burj Khalifa SKY, is located at level 148 and allows visitors to have an amazing view from the height of 555 meters. Burj Khalifa attracts millions of visitors every month. To reduce the daily crowds, the management of the tower encourages the online booking of tickets instead of the purchase on the spot (the purchase at the ticket offices on the spot is more expensive, the ticket lines are long and the tickets sell out quickly).</p>
